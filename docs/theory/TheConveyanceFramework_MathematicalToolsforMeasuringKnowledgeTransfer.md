# The Conveyance Framework: Mathematical Measurement of Information Transfer

The Conveyance Framework (CF) provides mathematical tools for measuring information transfer effectiveness in **bounded, observable contexts**. By operationalizing concepts from Actor-Network Theory (ANT), Rogers' Diffusion Studies, and Shannon's Information Theory, it enables quantitative prediction where traditional methods offer qualitative description.

**What This Framework IS**: Measurement tools for specific mechanisms in contexts where transfer variables are observable and outcomes documentable.

**What This Framework IS NOT**: Complete formalization of anthropological theory or applicable to internal cognition and complex sociocultural n-body problems.

## Validation Status Summary (December 2025)

**Established Evidence:**

- Mathematical structure validated (12/12 Wolfram computational tests)
- Core equation zero-propagation properties confirmed
- External parameter convergence: α ≈ 1.8 (Farghly et al., diffusion models) aligns with α ∈ [1.5, 2.0] (cultural pilot study)
- Pilot case study: Transformers adoption (predicted 21:1, observed ~35:1 ratio vs Capsules)

**Requiring Multi-Researcher Validation:**

- Cultural variable assessment protocols (single-researcher pilot completed)
- Systematic anthropological methodology across multiple cases

**Theoretical Proposals Awaiting Empirical Validation:**

- Geometric alignment refinements (C_ext_effective formula)
- AI knowledge distillation predictions
- Measurement protocols for G_alignment in production systems
- Effectiveness thresholds (>70% for G_alignment > 0.7)

**Timeline**: 6-18 months for computational validation; 18-36 months for systematic anthropological validation.

## Core Mathematical Structure

The framework measures conveyance effectiveness between entities i and j:

$$C_{pair}(i \leftrightarrow j) = H_{mean}(C_{out}, C_{in}) \times C_{ext}^{\alpha} \times P_{ij}$$

This structure reflects empirically observed patterns in bounded contexts:

### 1. Bilateral Success Requirement (Harmonic Mean)

$H_{mean}(C_{out}, C_{in})$ captures that transfer requires success in **both** sending and receiving. The harmonic mean approaches zero when either component is weak, matching observed adoption patterns.

**Evidence Status**: Validated in Transformers case study; mathematical properties confirmed via Wolfram.

### 2. Hard Dependencies (Multiplicative Structure)

Multiplication reflects that missing prerequisites cause complete failure. If $C_{ext} = 0$ (no boundary objects) or $P_{ij} = 0$ (incompatible protocols), then $C_{pair} = 0$.

**Evidence Status**: Mathematically validated; observed in cultural transfer failures; systematic validation across AI systems pending.

### 3. Super-Linear Context Effects

$C_{ext}^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha > 1$ quantifies non-linear amplification where rich shared context helps disproportionately more than minimal context.

**Evidence Status**:

- **Established**: Farghly et al. (2025) measured α ≈ 1.8 in diffusion models through mathematical analysis
- **Supported**: Cultural pilot study suggests α ∈ [1.5, 2.0] (requires multi-researcher validation)
- **Predicted**: AI distillation experiments hypothesized to show similar range (measurement pending)

## Quantification of Observable Variables

Variables are assessed through systematic observation protocols (0-10 scales normalized to [0,1]):

| Variable | Observable Phenomenon | Theoretical Antecedent | Status |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|---------|
| **W** | Signal quality/clarity | Operationalizes Rogers' *Relative advantage* | Protocol validated |
| **R** | Positioning/findability | Operationalizes Rogers' *Observability* | Protocol validated |
| **H** | Capability/resources | Operationalizes Rogers' *Trialability* | Protocol validated |
| **C_ext** | Shared boundary objects | Quantifies Latour's *Boundary objects* | Protocol validated |
| **P_ij** | Protocol compatibility | Quantifies Rogers' *Compatibility* | Protocol validated |
| **α** | Context amplification | Quantifies Latour's *Network amplification* | Parameter: converging evidence |

**Assessment Validation**: Single-researcher protocols tested; multi-researcher reliability studies (Krippendorff's α > 0.67) planned for systematic validation.

## Integration with Anthropological Theory

The framework provides quantitative operationalization **in bounded, observable contexts**:

### Actor-Network Theory

Quantifies boundary objects ($C_{ext}$), actor compatibility ($P_{ij}$), and network transformation ($C_{pair}$ prediction) for systems where variables are ethnographically observable or computationally measurable.

**Status**: First mathematical framework quantifying specific ANT mechanisms in bounded contexts; does not claim to formalize ANT broadly.

### Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations

Takes ethnographically documented factors and provides quantitative prediction methodology for contexts with measurable adoption outcomes.

**Status**: Pilot validated (Transformers case); systematic validation across multiple cultural domains planned.

### Shannon's Information Theory

Extends Shannon's transmission mathematics by adding semantic/cultural dimensions (W, H, P, C_ext), receiving community focus, and bilateral success requirement.

**Status**: Mathematical structure validated; empirical validation ongoing.

---

## Geometric Alignment Refinements (Theoretical)

**Hypothesis Status**: These refinements are theoretical proposals based on convergent mathematical and ethnographic insights; systematic empirical validation is pending.

### Central Hypothesis

Transfer effectiveness depends not only on content magnitude but on geometric compatibility between representation formats and processing architectures.

### Proposed Mathematical Extensions

**Geometric transformation of capability:**
$$H_{effective} = H_{baseline} \times T_{geometric}(alignment, direction)$$

**Geometric modulation of context:**
$$C_{ext\_effective} = C_{ext\_magnitude} \times G_{alignment}^{\gamma}$$

Where $G_{alignment} \in [0,1]$ measures representational compatibility.

### Supporting Evidence

**Mathematical Foundation**:

- Farghly et al. (2025) demonstrate geometric preservation determines amplification in diffusion models
- Log-domain smoothing preserves manifold structure; data-domain smoothing destroys it
- Independent α ≈ 1.8 measurement supports geometric mechanisms

**Ethnographic Illustration** (not validation):

- Technical blueprint transfer failure despite complete instructions
- Transfer succeeded only after geometric transformation bridges provided
- Demonstrates concept of geometric mismatch; does not validate mathematical framework

**Predicted Applications** (requiring validation):

- LLM knowledge distillation effectiveness should correlate with dimensional compression ratio: $G_{dimensional} \approx H_{student} / H_{teacher}$
- AI alignment transfer should depend on embedding space compatibility
- Interpretability format effectiveness should vary by geometric compatibility with human reasoning architecture

### Proposed Measurement Protocols

**Five protocols for measuring G_alignment in production systems:**

1. **Representation Dimension Analysis**: $G_{alignment} = \min(D_{sender}, D_{receiver}) / \max(D_{sender}, D_{receiver})$
2. **Transfer Trajectory Tracking**: Measure deviation from optimal geodesic paths
3. **Bi-Directional Transfer Asymmetry**: Compare forward vs reverse transfer effectiveness
4. **Multi-Modal Alignment Scoring**: Quantify alignment across representation modalities
5. **Context Window Utilization**: Correlate efficiency with transfer success

**Status**: Methodologies proposed; validation experiments planned using Metis infrastructure (2.8M arXiv papers, GraphSAGE GNN) over 6-18 months.

### Predicted Effectiveness Thresholds

**Hypothesized relationships** (pending empirical validation):

- **G_alignment < 0.3**: Predict high failure rate (estimated >70%)
- **G_alignment 0.3-0.7**: Predict partial success (estimated 30-60%)
- **G_alignment > 0.7**: Predict successful transfer (estimated >70%)

**Validation Methodology**: Measure G_alignment for 100+ arXiv papers, track adoption via GitHub/citations, compute correlation (target: Spearman r > 0.5).

**Falsification Criterion**: If G_alignment shows no correlation (r < 0.2) with outcomes across 100+ cases, geometric hypothesis requires substantial revision or rejection.

## Dual Validation Strategy

### Cultural Transfer (Anthropological)

- Complex real-world scenarios with decades of outcome data
- All variables ethnographically observable
- Natural experiments across communities
- **Current Status**: Pilot validation (Transformers case); systematic multi-researcher validation planned (18-36 months)

### AI Systems (Computational)

- Controlled experiments with quantifiable metrics
- Fully observable variables, reproducible measurements
- Enables falsification through systematic testing
- **Current Status**: Infrastructure development (Metis platform); experiments planned (6-18 months)

### Methodological Rationale

Convergence across both domains—where mathematical, ethnographic, and computational evidence align—demonstrates framework captures fundamental information dynamics rather than domain-specific artifacts or researcher bias.
